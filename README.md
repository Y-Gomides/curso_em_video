📚 This directory stores the exercises from the Python course on the Curso em Vídeo platform, which I am taking.

📝 This is not intended to be structured. Just a showcase for interested parties to follow my development.

💡 My resolutions are independent, without resorting to the answers provided by the teacher. This means that many algorithms will be different from those presented in the course.

📅 The exercises started from Lesson 5 of the course, and are separated accordingly.
