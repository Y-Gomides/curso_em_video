📚 This repository contains the exercises from the Python course I’m taking on the Curso em Vídeo platform.

📝 It’s not meant to be structured. It’s just a way for interested people to follow my progress.

💡 I solve the exercises on my own, without looking at the teacher’s answers. So, many of my solutions will be different from those shown in the course.

📅 The exercises start from Lesson 5 and are organized accordingly.
