📚 This repository stores the exercises from the Python course taught by Professor Gustavo Guanabara, from the Curso em Vídeo channel, which I am taking.

📝 It is not intended to be structured. It serves only as a showcase for those interested to follow my progress in the course.

💡 My solutions are done independently, without resorting to the solutions provided by the professor. This means that many algorithms will be different from those presented in the course, but they are still functional.

📅 The exercises started from Lesson 5 of the course and are separated accordingly.
